# Inversion and Optimisation - Assessment 1

This is the first assessment for the Inversion and Optimisation module.
It forms 60% of the overall mark for the module, the other 40% is based on the
second assessment in week 3.

It consists of two parts:

Part I covers lectures 1-7 (75 pts)

Part II covers lectures 8  (25 pts) 

Instructions:

* This is independent work, you cannot work in groups.

* Please provide your answers in each of the two notebooks seperately.

* For questions that involve coding please include the output, printed output or graphs,
that show the correct behaviour of your implementation without the need to rerun your code. However you do need to make sure that your code _can_ be rerun by executing the relevant cells in (top-to-bottom) order.

* You are allowed to use NumPy and Scipy and any code from the lecture notes in your answers.

* For answers that involve mathematical equations, use the usual combination of markdown and latex, or, if your prefer, include a photo/scan of your handwritten answer in the notebook.

* Even if you're not completely sure how to complete a part of the question, our advice is to submit something, even if it's just your ideas on how to go about answering the question, as you could well score some marks.

* Make sure you always explain what you are doing. Instead of only producing a graph or some code output, write something below it like "In this graph we can see that ... Therefore ..."
